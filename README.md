# Fundamental Programming Practices

My first month at formally learning Java Language.

Contained here is class projects that have been done in
a period of one month. The school uses a block system.
So we ideally do a course a month. You miss a day or two
then expect a huge backlog the next day to catch up with.

So, each subdir to this project is a project that was given out
in class. All the solutions are mine unless stated otherwise.

Some documentation for the challenges are found in the Wiki pages.
So, feel free to check too.

Each Project will have a README that explains what is in
and what the target of the assignment was.

I may come back and make some modifications to the code, as my
experience with Java grows!

Should you find anything amiss, let me know!
