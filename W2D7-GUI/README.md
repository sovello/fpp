### Building GUIs in Java with Swing.

Lab :

1. Do   prog7-1_address_form from the Wiki

2. Do   prog7-2_string_util from the Wiki

3. In the Ch7TextFrame1 class, (from the Wiki) event handling
was done with this class. Modify the class so the button
events are handled by a `ButtonHandler` class, and the text events are handled by a
`TextHandler` class. You can use the `ButtonHandler`
class defined in the lesson, but you need to define your own `TextHandler` class.

4. Write a MyMenuFrame class with these menu choices.

    
    |File   |Edit  |Color |
    |-------|------|------|
    |Quit   |Erase |Red	  |
    |  	    |	   |Green |
    |	    |	   |Blue  |
    |	    |	   |Pink  |
    |	    |	   |Black |

    When the user selects Quit, stop the program.  When the user selects one of the colors, change
    the background of the frame (i.e., change the background color of the frameâ€™s content pane)
    to the selected color.  When the user selects Erase, reset the background color to white.

5. Extra Credit :

   Create a GUI application for a registrar system at a university.  You will need
   students, professors, courses, grades, etc.  Design the GUI screens yourself
   and make it as complete and full as time allows.
