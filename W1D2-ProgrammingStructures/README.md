### Instructions for Project One.

1. Create a Java method `static int min(int[] arrayOfInts)` that outputs the minimum of an array of ints. Create a main method that tests your method on the following input array

```
[2, -21, 3, 45, 0, 12, 18, 6, 3, 1, 0, -22]
```

... Test your method and make sure it works!


2. Do the same as above but instead of the minimum find the average of the numbers in the array.  Test it.
3. Write a program that reads a sentence and prints out the sentence with all uppercase letters changed to lowercase and all lowercase letters changed to uppercase.

... _Hint :  Look at the API documentation for the  Character  class to see which methods you can use._

4. On page 99, there is table 3-8.  We will only use the top three rows.
   Create a two dimensional table with  3  rows and  6  columns.
   Put the data from the top 3 rows of table 3-8 into your table.

... * Print out the average of each row.
... * Print out the average of each column.
